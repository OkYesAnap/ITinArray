    Different types of system structure use different triggers. 
    Some triggers require user to do certain action (e.g. type phone 
    number for the system to call that person), others get triggered 
    by certain activities related to the user (e.g. person calling 
    user's phone), however in both types of the system the output 
    could be similar (e.g. phone rings).`;
